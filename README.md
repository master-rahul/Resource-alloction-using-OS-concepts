# Barber-and-Customer-Problem-Solving-using-Operating-System-Concepts
This project is program for handling the customers in a barber shop depending upon the number of chairs. It is based on Operating System Concepts.
Design a scheduling program that is capable of scheduling many processes that comes in at some time interval and are allocated the CPU not more than 10 time units. CPU must schedule processes having short execution time first. CPU is idle for 3 time units and does not entertain any process prior this time. Scheduler must maintain a queue that keeps the order of execution of all the processes. Compute average waiting and turnaround time.
